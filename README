README for LargeMD-event.py

Please cite DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b04863.
This script detects and analyzes interlayer surface restructuring events from a large-scale LAMMPS MD trajectory.

Note 1: Intended only for interlayer surface restructuring events in FCC metals.
Note 2: Intended only for periodic slab models with vacuum along the z-direction.
Note 3: Intended only for LAMMPS NVT simulations.
Note 4: Intended only for estimation of the event statistics, up to bimetallic systems. Please confirm with visual inspection as needed.

Note 5: Requires a LAMMPS DATA file containing the equilibrated box dimensions.
Note 6: Requires a LAMMPS DUMP file containing the clamped trajectory (via lmpclamp.py), dumped every ps, xy-unwrapped, with coordination numbers - (id, type, xu, yu, z, c_cn)
Note 7: Requires lmpdump.py to load the trajectory.

-----

This script requires an input file 'input.txt', listing the following variables line-by-line, variable & argument separated by white space:

clamp_dump = Name of the LAMMPS DUMP file containing the clamped trajectory (via lmpclamp.py), dumped every ps, xy-unwrapped, with coordination numbers - (id, type, xu, yu, z, c_cn)
eq_data = Name of the LAMMPS DATA file containing the equilibrated box dimensions
ID_nn1 = Integer ID of a nearest-neighbor atom that lies in the same layer as atom #1
ID_nn2 = Integer ID of another nearest-neighbor atom that lies in the same layer as atom #1
ID_1up = Integer ID of an atom that lies one layer above atom #1
